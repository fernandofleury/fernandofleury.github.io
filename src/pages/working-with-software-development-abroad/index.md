### What I learned during the hiring and relocation process to a new place.

This topic involves several different points, but I will try to talk about it following a chronological order, **everything following my point of view.**

### Language / Communication

I think it's one of the things I hear most about the subject. There is usually a feeling of "Do I know enough?" (Systems development is an area that is surrounded by a lot of emotional insecurity, but I will deal with that a little more in the next few paragraphs).

I understand communication as the ability to understand what someone has to say, and to make themselves understood. Anything beyond that is already a bonus. When it comes to English (which is a huge advance to be able to evolve in the area, and is the language used in Development), I see a lot of people speaking and believing that they don't know how to speak. But when you press and need to risk some communication, you end up turning around. I honestly think that this type of communication is enough to make you manage in most situations that you can go abroad. What you don't know how to say you end up being able to speak in one way or another. But to pass perrengue, it will hardly pass.

And well, how do you know if you can speak at least the minimum acceptable? If you already scratch a few words here and there, you can read the texts on development on the web, my suggestion is to join the process of some company. It may sound a little too much, but you will have to do it anyway if you really want to go abroad.

In these situations it is very important to remember the following point: If it doesn't work, for whatever point, just practice that point and try again. Generally, companies have a minimum time for you to apply for the process again (This considering that you want that specific company).

We are so afraid to think that it is not good enough for X or Y, that we are afraid to try.

If you think you need to improve your language, here is how often and how fast you want to learn. The basic recommendation is to take a course focused on communication. Since you learn the nuances, you learn hard. But this is definitely not a point that should prevent you from having that experience, at most postponing.

### Technical knowledge

In general, we end up believing that technical knowledge is the determining factor to be able to enter some company abroad, but it is similar to what we have here. What is generally sought is a skill set. If I were to sum it up in a rough way, it would be like:

- Technical knowledge

- Self-management

- Interest in the Product / Company (you just need to appear to have)

- Team work

- Soft skills in general

- A “motivation to leave your current place” (Like wanting a “quality of life” different from what you have today).

_Generally this question draws the attention of recruiters / HR from companies. Something close to a “level of employee commitment” thermometer ._

**I believe that each company has its own values, and weight for each one of them. This is my perception in a general way, it does not mean that it is something written in stone. But I believe that if you follow these topics you will be very well qualified to act anywhere in the world.**

This parallel does not escape the moment of the market that we have here. The biggest difference (for those who want to leave, of course) is outside companies generally looking for professionals at the Full / Senior level (I will not discuss labels in this text). So those who think they are "Juniors" may feel that this is not the time for this experience. But as I have been reinforcing throughout the text, all of our perception of where we fit in, and how we are positioned is based on our local market and not the global one.

As much as it may look like currant, the real thing is that the only thing you need to be trained for the job are some key technical requirements _. _ Usually the domain of a specific framework / library (according to the company), versioning and tooling is enough (really). This is a little different from the vacancies we see here, which sometimes ask for a huge list that we know is not necessary to actually do the job. But this topic is not the scope of the text.

And how do you know if you are at a legal technical level to work abroad? My suggestion is to join the process of some company. Maybe this may sound a little too much, but you will have to do it anyway if you really want to go abroad (I copied and pasted the Language topic).

If you think you need to improve some technical aspects, it is important to understand the moment of the area vs the market (What is happening in your Development area vs what the market requires in your area). For example: In the Front-end area there has been a lot of talk about WebAssembly, but today this is not a requirement for the Front-end market. Only it is a good idea to keep an eye on it because it could be something that will become a differentiator in the coming months.

After this kind of reflection, it is good to understand what companies are looking for. So today it is no longer a differential that you know react (either vue or angular2), you kind of have to know (Of course there are companies that do not require it, but this is a generalization of the market). Once this is done, it is “just” to study what is on the agenda and that is it.

A very strong impression that I have is that we ended up seeing work abroad as the “next step”, that everything around it will demand more from us than any work we have here. And this is honestly not true. The company I am in today requires much less of me technically than the company I used to work with before leaving Brazil. Of course, it's not just the technician that matters (We put N items on the scale before making these decisions), but my point is that going outside does not necessarily mean a challenge that you can only achieve when you "exhaust" all your sources of local knowledge .

I think it's important to hit this point, because we tend to put ourselves too low in relation to others (Emotional insecurity). And in my opinion (it is good to emphasize that this opinion is my own, so as not to generate controversy), the developers of the Brazilian market are very well trained, and from the experiences I had, they are in general more qualified than developers from other places. Of course, there are excellent developers around the globe, but I mean market level, most Brazilian developers are better able compared to other markets.

### Hiring process

Well, this part is absurdly related to the place you choose to apply (or places). If you don't have a specific place, there are some places where you can look for places. Like LinkedIn, StackOverflow, or even go to the companies' websites and see if they have a form for selection there.

After you apply for the vacancy (regardless of how you found it), it's worth taking a look at [https://www.glassdoor.com](https://www.glassdoor.com). There you will find some information such as the company's salary range and some information about the selection process (like questions asked, or logic tests that may require). There are people who don't like it and think it's "stealing" in the process. For me it is preparation.

It is very important to remember that the process of these companies is usually much longer than ours. The interviews take intervals of weeks, and in more extreme cases up to months (Usually in companies with the process with a lot of candidate). So go on with your life for the mean time. Cool to stay motivated to study for any topic if it is necessary for the process, but do not let anxiety take care of you, I say this on my own. The interviews sometimes had a very long interval, and the wait between each step ended me. I think it is worse not to know if I passed or not than not to pass.

In this topic I don't have many tips. Just study for what you think is necessary (according to the requirements of the vacancy), reconcile the anxiety of the process with the day to day and the most important thing is not to be discouraged.

If you don't go to the company (s) you tried, really **don't get discouraged**. It doesn't mean that you're not good enough, it means that you and the company don't fit. It is important to remember that the hiring process is valid for both sides. You also need to identify with the company. And if you really liked the place, ask for feedback and try again after their allotted time.

**About the next topic already has a lot of content, but I will reinforce the points that made a difference for me. I made some pretty stupid decisions right away.**

### Relocation Process

Here it is very important to understand how the company is willing to help you.

The companies I saw provide a relocation service (Outsourced) that is there to help you with the following topics:

- Documentation required for relocation (Any document that is needed on their side, will be made by them. For example, pay the visa fee and check in)

- Commitments for relocation (For example, schedule a bank account opening, make an appointment with the expat center to purchase an “rg” for that specific place)

- Help to find a place for you to live / Help with the paperwork of the place for you to live.

- Reallocation of your assets (If you have something here that you want to take to the place)

And companies help with:

- Purchase of airline ticket

- Renting a temporary hotel for a specified time (To help you find somewhere to live)

In the company that I am in, they call this _ relocation fund_. You have a predetermined amount to spend on relocation costs. If you need to stay in the hotel longer, or would like to buy a ticket for another class, that money comes out of that fund.

**All points mentioned vary completely from company to company. There is no standard on how the company will help you with relocation. Remember to ask how the process will work and what costs you will have to bear. I can't reinforce this enough.**

There are some documents that you will need to take from here in Brazil. The company will inform you, and whether or not you will have to pay for them varies according to the company (Again). **Here it is important to remember that the company does not know how long it takes for documents to be ready in Brazil, it is not about being slow / fast, it is just that they do not know. Keep this in mind when planning to take the documents, very important to have it ready as soon as possible.**

Another important point is the time of the relocation process. It will vary based **on your availability**. This is usually sort of agreed upon during the hiring process. Assuming you already have a deadline to leave, keep an eye on the currency quote you are going to use there, because you will need to take some with you.

How much money do you need to bring? It depends. You need to take some money to spend a month. This month you spend as you like, eating frozen food, or going to a restaurant, who knows. The important thing is that you take a little extra in case of an emergency. The more is up to you too. I took money to pay my rent, change my macbook and a little more to spend the month. In the end I didn't even buy the macbook because I was taken aback by the rental prices / rental model around here.

You can use sites that compare the cost of living between places (like this one [https://www.expatistan.com](https://www.expatistan.com/cost-of-living/country/netherlands)). But remember to ask the company (Or look on the internet) how does the provision of services work in place. Life Insurance, Rent, Internet, Telephone and so on. We have a premise of what is “mandatory to live” that can be different from the place. The important thing is to try to understand the basics to get prepared.

### About the workplace

Here I have little to say, first because it is very relative. It varies from company to company. But it is important to keep the thought that you are an employee who is working and that's it.

It may sound silly, but I have seen some people very afraid of hitting the ball with the company, complaining about something, or even changing jobs because I believed I owed the company something, because it "brought" him there.

The company understands the value of your work, and would like you to be part of it. You paid for your salary and you worked, simple as that. Just a contract. Don't be afraid to be a foreigner, to have an accent, sometimes to put a word around, or not to know any term in that language. Don't be in a hurry to be productive, companies are generally fully aware that you are not only adapting to a new work environment, but you are also adapting to a new culture. Mainly don't be afraid to be Brazilian. It is important to emphasize that if you were hired, it is because your work is respected and you should feel that way too.

### Conclusion

I could talk about it for a long time, but the idea is to give you a general idea of ​​what it is like to try to go abroad (and a little bit of what it is like to actually go after the hiring).

The text is indeed well opinionated, and I must have said some shit in the middle. So I sincerely ask that no one get me wrong. The idea is not to offend or belittle anyone's effort. Just to demonstrate that the process is much less complex than people usually imagine. **I believe that we are very stuck with fear that it is not the moment. That we are never good enough for that. Give yourself the freedom to try. This is much closer than we think it really is.**
