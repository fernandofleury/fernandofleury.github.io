### What I learned during the hiring process, relocation and adaptation process for new places.

This subject contains several distinct points. But I will try to talk about following a chronological order, **all according to my point of view and based on the Brazilian Market. Take it with a grain of salt.**

### Language and Communication

I think it's one of the things I hear most about about. There is usually a feeling of "Do I know enough?"

First things first, I perceive communication as the ability to understand what someone has to say, and to make themselves understood. Anything beyond that is already a bonus. When it comes to English (which whether we like it or not, is key in our area), it is honestly something you can improve as you go. You don't need to be extremely proficient with it to be able to work abroad.

And well, how do you know if you "know enough"? If you already express some of your thoughts in English, and you can read tech articles in English (mostly due to the tech jargons), my suggestion is to go ahead and try out a hiring process of some company. It may sound a little too much, but you will have to do it anyway if you really want to go abroad. You'll be surprised or how much you and other people actually know.

In these situations it is very important to remember: If it doesn't work for whatever reason, focus on that reason and try again. Generally, companies have a minimum time for you to apply for the process again (This considering that you want that specific company). It shows that you are committed and willing to work on feedback.

It might sound silly, but finding a job is a two way road. Just because it didn't work with a specific company, it doesn't mean that it was your "fault" per say. You should also be looking for the right fit for you.

If you think you need to improve your language, here is how often and how fast you want (or can) learn. The basic recommendation is to take lessons focused on communication/conversation. Since the nuances you'll learn as you speak. I certainly learned a lot during the first months I was abroad.

### Technical knowledge

In general, we end up believing that technical knowledge is the determining factor to be able to join an abroad company, but what is generally sought is a skill set. If I were to sum it up in a rough way, it would be like:

- Technical knowledge
- Empathy
- Respect
- Self-management
- Interest in the Product / Company
- Team work
- Communication

**I believe that each company has its own values, and weight for each one of them. But I also believe that if you focus on these topics you will be very well qualified to work anywhere in the world.**

The biggest difference compared to our local market (Brazil) is abroad companies are generally looking for professionals at the Senior level (I will not discuss labels in this text). So those who think they are "Juniors" may feel that this is not the time for this experience. But as I have been reinforcing throughout the text, our entire perception of where we fit in, and how we are positioned is based on our local market and not the global one.

As much as it may look like baloney, you don't need to have a super extensive toolkit of programming languages and frameworks. Being able to perform a specific domain well enough (such as using Angular, Vue, or React. Not all of them).

Usually having the domain of a specific framework / library (according to the specific company), writing tests, code versioning and tooling is more than enough (for real). This is a little different from the job posts we see here in Brazil, which sometimes ask for a huge list that we know is not necessary to actually do the job. But this topic is not the scope of the text.

And how do you know if you are at a "good" technical level to work abroad? My suggestion _again_ is to join the hiring process of some companies.

In case you think you need to improve some technical aspects, it is important to understand the moment of the development area vs the market (What is happening in your development area vs what the market requires in your area).

A very strong impression that I have is that we ended up seeing work abroad as the “next step”, that everything around it will demand more from us than any work we ever had. And this is honestly not true. The company I am in today requires much less of me technically than the company I used to work with before leaving Brazil. Of course, it's not just the techinical bits that matters (We should add N items on the scale before making these decisions), but my point is that going outside does not necessarily mean a challenge that you can only reach when you "exhaust" all your sources of local knowledge.

### Hiring process

Well, this part is absurdly related to the company you choose to apply (or places). If you don't have a specific company, there are some websites where you can look for. Like LinkedIn, Twitter, StackOverflow, or even go to the companies' websites and see if they have a form for selection there.

After you apply for the job (regardless of how you found it), it's worth taking a look at [https://www.glassdoor.com](https://www.glassdoor.com). There you will find information such as the company's salary range and about the hiring process (like questions asked, or logic tests).

It is very important to remember that the hiring process to work abroad is way longer than local. The interviews can have longer gaps (even weeks), and in more extreme cases up to months. So go on with your life in the mean time, but do not let anxiety take the best of you. The interviews sometimes had a very long interval, and the wait between each step killed me.

For this topic I don't have that many tips. Focus on solving technical challenges ([https://www.codewars.com/](https://www.codewars.com/) is a great tool for that) and revisit algorithms/data structures.The most important thing is not to be discouraged.

In case it doesn't work out, **don't get discouraged**. It doesn't mean that you're not good enough, it means that you and the company are not the same fit. It is important to remember that the hiring process is valid for both sides. You also need to identify with the company. And if you really liked the company, ask for feedback and try again after their allotted time.

### About the workplace

Here I have little to say, because honestly it is very relative. It is important to keep the thought that you are an employee who is working for said company and that's it.

It may sound silly, but I have seen some people very afraid of dropping the ball with the company, complaining about something, or even changing jobs because they believed they owed the company something, because it "brought" them there. You don't "own" them anything.

The company understands the value of your work. They pay for your salary and you work, simple as that. Just a contract.

Don't be afraid to be a foreigner, to have an accent, to sometimes maybe not know the right word to describe something.

Don't be in a hurry to be productive, companies are generally fully aware that you are not only adapting to a new work environment, but you are also adapting to a new culture. Mainly don't be afraid to be yourself. It is important to emphasize that if you were hired, it is because your work is appreciated and you should feel that way too.

### Living in another country

The golden tip here is _learn the native language_ as soon as possible. I lived in some countries already and I decided to not do it, this is certainly my biggest regret. You end up living only a part of culture and in the long run it is detrimental even to your health.

Try to get out of the comfort zone a little and meet new people, you have an excellent opportunity to expand your horizons and not make it just a work experience. We are very lucky for that.

### Conclusion

I could talk about this for a long time, but the idea is to give you a general snapshot of ​​what it is like to try to go abroad (and a little bit of what it is really like to go after the hiring).

The text is indeed very opinionated, and I must have said some nonsense. The idea is not to offend or belittle anyone's effort. Just to demonstrate that the process is much less complex than people usually imagine. **I believe that we are usually stuck with the idea that it is not the moment. That we are never good enough for that. Allow yourself to try. This is much closer than we think it really is.**
